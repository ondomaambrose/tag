      "The Total Man Concept (TMC) at Covenant University is designed to raise a new generation of leaders through holistic development. It emphasizes that personal transformation begins with the 'new birth,' which restores an individual's identity and nature through Christ. The philosophy of 'Life-matics' teaches students the science of living successfully by deliberately developing the spirit, soul, and body. Faith is presented as a primary spiritual weapon that requires belief, trust, and action to produce physical results. Divine direction is viewed as a birthright that provides individuals with accuracy in decision-making and divine protection.",

    title: "Total Man Concept",
    description:
      " This course defines man as a triune being: a spirit who possesses a soul (mind, will, and emotions) and lives in a physical body. Healthy relationships are built on character rather than technical skills, requiring effective self-management as a prerequisite for managing others. Faith is presented not as a theory but as a spiritual force that remains dormant without corresponding personal action. Mastering focus is critical for success, as attention is a limited resource that must be guarded against modern digital distractions. Every human achievement begins as an idea, making the mind a production facility that must be fed with quality information. Divine ideas for life and leadership are birthed through scriptural meditation and a quiet, disciplined mental environment. Purpose is the original intent for a person's existence, which must be discovered through one's calling and pursued with persistence. Successful ministry is a divine assignment that requires faithfulness, organized administration, and adherence to spiritual principles. Ultimately, graduates are encouraged to seek wholistic growth by balancing spiritual depth, mental sharpness, and physical wellness",
